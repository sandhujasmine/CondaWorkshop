# CondaWorkshop

__If you don't have conda installed - download Miniconda 3.x for your system__: http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html


Here is basic outline for PuPPy's Anaconda workshop. It'll be hands on so we'll work through installing conda, setting up environments and get a feel for conda usage.

In the meetup, ask what OS the participants will be using.
